# Project Title
Authiclay

## Project Description
A small sized authenticator system using pure NodeJs, that acts as a 2 Factor authentication for web applications.

## Prerequisites
Node Js

## The Process
The first step was to create a Folder named NodeJs Project which was opened in VS code.

Afterwards, on the terminal, the project was initialized using 'npm init', which created the package.json file.

Following that, the entry file, "index.js" was created.

Then, in the entry file, the in-built Node Js modules, "http" (for creating the server) and "fs" (to read files) were required and a port number was assigned.

After that, the server was created using the "http.createServer" function as well as the "listen" function for incoming requests, containing the assigned port number to handle the requests as well as a call back function to show that the app is running in the console.
